## Observations

•	Looking at the different drugs and their effect on the tumor size, 
it is clear how Capomulin is one of the most effective drugs. It was the 
most used drug and one of the best drugs to shrink the tumor size. For example, 
on average Capomulin was effective in shrinking the tumor volume from 45mm t0 36.2mm. 


•	I went ahead and look at the mice that got treated with Capomulin and made a graph. 
By grouping all of the mice and getting the average size at each timepoint there is a clear trend 
where the volume of the tumor decreases with time. Ramicane and Capomulin where the only drugs that have a 
positive effect on the shrinkage of the tumor. The other drugs either made the tumor grow or had 
no effect on the mice. Ramicane seems to be the best drug.  On average at the end of the test the volume
of the tumor was 34.9mm compared to the 36.2mm of Capomulin.

•	I also concluded that as the weight of the mice increases it was harder for the drug to 
have an effect on the tumor. On a scatter plot I showed these two variables together and how weight and 
tumor volume are correlated. If the mice is more on the heavy side of the observation in general the 
tumor did not change it’s volume. It looks like the drug has more effect for mice that weight less than 17g.
